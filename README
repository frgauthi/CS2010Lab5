Author: Frankie Gauthier
Class: CS2010 Lab4

Compile
--------

-to compile the program simply type "make" on the cmd line in the CS2010Lab4 directory

-to run type ./memory and observe the output

Output
-------

- the program creates memory with a default size of 100

- the program fills each mem location with its index value
  so memory is 100 units filled with 0-99

- then the even numbers are set to 0

- then memory is copied from 20-35 to 40-55

- the memory is then dumped from loc 40-55 to show the result

- all of memory is then dumped at the end to show its final state
